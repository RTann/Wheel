Wheel
=====
Graphic will be of a wheel and ground (similar to idea from earlier this year).
Click on wheel. Length of time of click will determine Force placed on the wheel (or can choose amt of force to always use). Depending on where force is applied will determine torque and whatnot for the speed of the wheel. Ground can have any amount of friction as wanted. Can click on the wheel from any direction, but will always be due left or right for sake of ease. Will only work if clicked within the wheel.
